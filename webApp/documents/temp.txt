routes.js requires installing react-router-dom for switching between different routes
npm i react-router-dom --force

now we need to place our components inside switch tag except navbar, sidebars and footer.

after that install react-bootstrap or any other libarary you want to use for styling or grid system
I have used react-bootstrap initially

npm i react-bootstrap --force

----------Bootstrap Grid system-------------------

Grid Classes
The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
